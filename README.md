# Java Learning Programs

## Overview
This repository contains several Java programs created as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course completed in 2023. The projects were designed to reinforce fundamental programming concepts, including OOP principles, user input handling, data formatting, and logical flow control. These programs serve as practical exercises for learning Java syntax, class structures, and algorithm implementation.

## Programs Included

### **Program01: Employee Payroll Calculator**
**Learning Objectives:**
- Handling user input using `Scanner`
- Formatting numerical output with `DecimalFormat`
- Performing basic arithmetic operations for payroll calculations
- Implementing simple tax deduction logic

**Description:**
This program collects employee details such as name, ID, hourly wage, and hours worked. It then calculates the gross pay, deducts a fixed tax percentage, and displays the final paycheck details.



### **Program02: Currency Breakdown Calculator**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Utilizing `Scanner` for user input  
- Implementing conditional logic for currency denomination calculations  
- Performing modular arithmetic operations  

**Description:**  
This program takes a dollar amount as input and breaks it down into various currency denominations (hundreds, fifties, twenties, tens, fives, ones, quarters, dimes, nickels, and cents). It applies division and modulo operations to determine the required count of each denomination.




### **Program03: Employee Class & Object-Oriented Approach**
**Learning Objectives:**
- Implementing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles
- Creating and utilizing Java classes and constructors
- Overriding `toString()` for structured output
- Separating concerns by encapsulating payroll logic in a dedicated class

**Description:**
This program introduces the `Employee` class, encapsulating payroll calculations into methods. It demonstrates object instantiation and method calls for calculating gross pay, tax deductions, and net pay. The class structure promotes modularity and reusability.



### **Program04: Bookstore and Library Book Management**
**Learning Objectives:**
- Implementing and using arrays to store objects
- Handling conditional statements and loops for user interaction
- Understanding constructor overloading and class-level variables
- Differentiating between bookstore and library books with class inheritance-like structures

**Description:**
This program simulates a book inventory system where users can create and categorize books as either bookstore or library books. It involves data entry, object creation, and information retrieval while reinforcing class design principles.



### **Program05: University People Management System**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Implementing **inheritance** for class hierarchy  
- Validating **unique 7-digit UCF IDs**  
- Handling **file input and output** for data persistence  
- Using **ArrayLists** for dynamic data storage  

**Description:**  
This program manages university personnel (faculty and students). It provides a menu-driven interface to add faculty members, enroll students in lectures, and validate user input. Faculty and students are stored in a unified data structure, ensuring organized and efficient data handling.




## Key Takeaways
These Java exercises provide hands-on experience in:  
- **Basic programming constructs**: Variables, loops, conditionals, and user input handling.  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and class structures.  
- **Data manipulation**: Arithmetic operations, modular arithmetic, and working with arrays and `ArrayList`.  
- **File handling**: Reading and writing data for persistence in text files.  
- **User interaction**: Menu-driven programs and structured output formatting.  
- **Real-world applications**: Payroll computation, financial calculations, and inventory management.
